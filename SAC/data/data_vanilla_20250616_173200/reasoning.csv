**Scene Description:**

My RGB sensor is capturing an indoor environment, likely an office space. I can see:

*   **Box:** A large cardboard box with the Amazon logo on it. This is a major obstacle.
*   **Recycle Bin:** A blue recycle bin. It's further away than the box but still an obstacle.
*   **Office Furniture:** A chair and a desk with a printer.
*   **Windows:** Large windows spanning most of the background which would provide the source of light.
*   **Carpeted Floor:** The ground is covered in grey carpet.

**Finding Max Sunlight Location:**

My solar panel needs sunlight. Sunlight comes from windows. The windows are behind the box. I need to navigate towards the windows to get closer to the sunlight.

**General Direction:**

The windows seem to span across the back of the room so going right would be the best direction to move.

**Action Selection:**

I have 5 possible actions. Based on the directions, I should move to the right.
*   Action 1 is too far to the left.
*   Action 2 is to the left and too close to the box.
*   Action 3 goes straight forward.
*   Action 4 is to the right and gets me closer to the windows.
*   Action 5 is too far to the right.

Action 4 seems to move me towards the right. Therefore, action 4 seems like the best choice.

**Final Answer:**
```json
{'action': 4}
```"

**Scene Understanding:**

I am in what appears to be an office or work area. I see a box with the Amazon logo in front of me, a recycling bin to the right, and office furniture (chair, desk, printer) to the left. Large windows are visible in the background, suggesting that the sunlight is coming through them. The strongest indication of sunlight would be near the windows, especially those not covered by blinds or curtains.

**Finding Max Sunlight Location:**

Based on the scene, the max sunlight location is likely to be towards the windows in the background. The location of the bin is between my position and the windows in the background, which makes it a reasonable place to search for the max sunlight location.

**Direction Decision:**

The best direction to move in is towards the windows, so that I can find the max sunlight location.

**Action Selection:**

Based on the red lines superimposed on the observation, Action 4 would move me closer to the windows and the recycling bin.

**Final Answer:**
```json
{'action': 4}
```"
