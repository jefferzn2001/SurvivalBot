To the left, there's a white wall with a door that appears to be closed. Further ahead, there's an open area with shelves, equipment, and what looks like a workspace. The right side of the image is dominated by a very close-up view of an object, possibly part of my own hardware. The background area near the windows seems brighter, suggesting that's where the sunlight is strongest.  **Finding Max Sunlight Location:**  Based on the image, the most likely location for maximum sunlight is near the windows in the background, on the right side of the image. The bright area suggests that's where the sunlight is entering the room.  **General Direction:**  I should head towards the bright area to the right, where the windows are located.  **Action Selection:**  Without knowing the exact layout of the potential movements and the locations of those circles, it's difficult to determine exactly which action is optimal. However, based on visual approximation, **action 5** moves towards the right side of the room where the sunlight appears strongest, so I believe action 5 is the best option.  **Final Answer:** ```json {'action': 5} ```"

There's a wooden door on the left, likely an exit. Further ahead, I see shelves and a computer desk area, and beyond that, what looks like large windows allowing sunlight to enter. A black trash can is by the shelves. The MAX SUNLIGHT LOCATION is most likely the windows in the distance.  **Direction:**  Based on the observations, the MAX SUNLIGHT LOCATION is towards the back of the room. I need to move away from the door and towards the windows.  **Action:**  Without any additional knowledge, action '4' appears to be the best option to move toward to SUNLIGHT.  ```json {'action': 4} ```"

I can see:  *   A door on the left. It appears to be closed. *   Shelving units filled with equipment in the back. *   A trash can near the door. *   A desk in the foreground with an object (possibly a sensor or other device) taking up most of the right side of the frame. *   Large windows along the back wall, suggesting a potential source of sunlight.  **Finding the Max Sunlight Location:**  Based on my knowledge, sunlight usually enters through windows. The windows in the back wall are the most likely source of sunlight in this scene. Therefore, the direction I should move in is towards the back wall.  **Determining the Best Action:**  Given the five red lines superimposed on the image, I need to determine which one points most directly towards the back wall where the windows are located.  Based on the image, and assuming the numbers are roughly in order, action 3 should point to the direction to windows in back.  **Final Answer:**  ```json {'action': 3} ```"

I see a closed wooden door to the left, a grey wall adjacent to the door. Further ahead, I see some shelving units, a desk with equipment, and what appears to be a window area with a lot of bright light coming in. The foreground is dominated by a grey object, likely the top of the table I'm on. The lighting is brightest towards the back, specifically near what looks like windows.  **Goal: Max Sunlight Location**  Based on the observation, the area with the most sunlight is clearly towards the back of the room, where the large windows are.  **Direction:**  I need to move toward the back of the room, away from the closed door and toward the windows.  **Action Selection:**  Given the red lines, I will choose the action that moves me towards the window.  **{'action': 3}**"

I can see a wooden door on the left side, along with a grey wall and what appears to be a metal storage unit with shelves in the background.  There are some desks or tables nearby. The lighting looks brightest coming from the windows in the background, so I assume that's where the sunlight is coming from. There's a desk in the foreground, with an object obstructing my view.  **Finding the Max Sunlight Location:**  Based on the image, the max sunlight location is likely coming from the windows in the back of the room. I can see the light is strongest there.  **General Direction:**  I need to move towards the back of the room to get closer to the windows and the sunlight.  **Action Selection:**  I need to move toward the windows at the back of the room.  **The answer is:** ```json {'action': 4} ```"

I am currently positioned on a table. I see a closed wooden door to my left. There's a wall with what appears to be a frosted glass window panel to the right of the door. Straight ahead, there is a larger room with several items: a black trash bin, what appears to be a metal shelf or cabinet, and several other tables/desks. The flooring is a gray carpet.  **Finding the MAX SUNLIGHT LOCATION:**  Given that my objective is to find the maximum sunlight, and based on general knowledge of office environments, the most likely location for sunlight to be entering the room is through the large windows that are straight ahead.   **Direction to Go In:**  I need to head straight to the larger room, and into the direction of the windows.  **Action Selection:**  Given the direction to move, action 3 should be taken.  ```json {'action': 3} ```"

I can see a door to my left, a cabinet, what looks like a desk or counter in the foreground, and some sticks in a vase. There are windows further back in the scene (likely on the right side of the room) allowing a lot of sunlight to pour through, which is where the MAX SUNLIGHT LOCATION is. There also appears to be a large object, possibly part of a camera or other device, very close in the foreground, which is obstructing part of the view.  **Leads on Finding Max Sunlight:**  The key lead is the presence of the bright windows in the back. Sunlight is clearly entering the room from that direction.  **General Direction:**  I need to move towards the windows in the back, which appears to be to my right relative to the picture.  **Action Selection:**  The only option that moves towards the windows is action 5.  **Final Answer:** ```json {'action': 5} ```"

To my left is a light-colored wall with some electrical outlets. Further to the left is a closed door, probably an exit. In front of me is a table. In the middle distance, I see shelving units stocked with items. Beyond that, there are large windows. The windows look like the most likely source of sunlight.  There's a dark object very close to the camera, obscuring a portion of the view, but it doesn't appear to be a barrier. There is also an object of interest in front of the table in the middle distance.  **Finding Max Sunlight Location:**  The largest windows in the back of the room are the most likely source of strong sunlight. Therefore, I need to move towards the back of the room.  **Determining Direction:**  I need to move straight ahead towards the windows.  **Action Selection:**  Based on the five red lines, option 4 best moves in the direction of the windows.  **Final Answer:** ```json {'action': 4} ```"

In the foreground, there's a grey surface of what appears to be a table or desk, with a dark object very close to the camera obscuring a large part of the view. Further back in the room, I can see a closed brown door on the left. To the right of the door, there's a grey wall and a metal shelving unit with various items on it. In the distance, there appear to be windows with bright sunlight streaming through. The floor is covered with grey carpet.  **Analysis for Max Sunlight Location:**  My primary goal is to find the max sunlight location. Based on the image, the most obvious source of sunlight is the windows in the background. Therefore, my goal is to move towards that area.  **Direction and Action:**  The windows appear to be in the center or slightly right, and I need to go towards them. So action 3 will give me the opportunity to do so.  **Proposed Action:**  ```json {'action': 3} ```"
