The windows are letting in a lot of sunlight, creating bright areas. The room appears to be carpeted. There are blinds on the windows. The light is coming from the windows, so the optimal locations are in front of them. Windows 0, 3, and 4 look very bright.  **Reasoning:**  To find the location with maximum sunlight, I need to move towards the brightest areas in the image, which appear to be the windows. I want to maximize the amount of sunlight hitting my solar panel. I should prioritize locations closest to the window on the right since the image shows more intense lighting.  **Action Selection:**  Based on my reasoning, the best action is to move towards the window on the right. I must chose between points 4 and 5. Point 0 is directly on the window and is likely impossible to navigate to. Based on the image, action 4 is the most direct route to getting closer to the light and more sun.  **Final Answer:** ```json {""action"": 4} ```"
