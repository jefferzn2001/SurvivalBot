I can see a black cable in the middle of the room, a black desk on the right, and a large black item in the corner of the room. I also see a table and chairs on the right side of the room. It appears that the window on the right is the only source of light in the room, and thus the MAX SUNLIGHT LOCATION. I should go in the direction of the right, as the right window is the nearest location of Max Sunlight. The best action to take is to go right toward the window.

I am most likely in an office or a similar setting, as there is a tripod next to me. It is possible that the nearest MAX SUNLIGHT LOCATION is outside, through the doorway. Therefore, I will attempt to head towards the open doorway.

It's likely in an office setting, as I can see a window in the background, some furniture, and shelves with a box on them. It's a bit difficult to tell which direction the sun is shining, but there is plenty of light coming from the window to the right.  Since I need to get to the MAX SUNLIGHT LOCATION, I should move towards the right.  This means the best action is to move towards action 5.

There are 2 chairs, a chair to the left is obscured by a robotic arm, and a chair to the right, both have no people in them. An empty chair is near the window, which would be a good spot for sunlight. It is likely that the window is where the maximum sunlight is coming from. 

Based on the observation and the understanding of sunlight, I should move to the right.
